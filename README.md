# ExoPlayerOverdrawBugDemo
Demo of a potential bug when swapping SimpleExoPlayerView objects with RESIZE_MODE_ZOOM enabled

![Example](Example.png?raw=true "Example")

This project also contains a working TextureView workaround which provides ExoPlayer with a TextureView surface, and demonstrates how to swap the texture. To enable this, change the main activity in the Manifest file to .TextureViewActivity
